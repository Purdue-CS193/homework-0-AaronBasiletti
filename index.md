# Aaron Basiletti's First CS193 Homework
### Things I enjoy about CS193
- I enjoy how relaxed the class feels.
- The instructors are fun and passionate about the class.
- No textbook is required, which means less money spent. 
- I will definitely appreciate the lack of midterm/final exams when the time comes. 

Thanks for reading!
